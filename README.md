# Schachbrett-Positionsanalyse

## Quickstart

Install requirements, for example via pip:  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`  

To install the chess engine stockfish, download it from https://stockfishchess.org/download/  
and set the link to the executable at Line 19 in File `src/Backend/Logic.py`  

Set up your camera to capture your chess board directly from above, then enter the folder `src` and run:  
`python main.py`  
Adjust your camera if the chess board is not completely visible in the image.
